### Falling
When at a concert Friday, I saw a computer animation with various 2d shapes
falling down, changing size according to the rythm of the music.

I want to try to replicate the former, but patience, I'm lacking the focus right now, so no functional (heh) code.

To use:

	pulp server

and then go to http://localhost:1337 . Well, as soon as I have pushed some code that is :-)
