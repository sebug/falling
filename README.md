### Falling
When at a concert Friday, I saw a computer animation with various 2d shapes
falling down, changing size according to the rythm of the music.

I want to try to replicate the former, but patience, I'm still working on it.

To use:

	mkdir dist
	pulp build -O --to dist/Main.js

And then open index.html
